I am a software engineer building for the web and Linux distros. My interests lie in building enterprise-level applications and crafting UI/UX that's ergonomic to use.

My recent experience was as a full-stack developer intern at [Garden Finance](https://garden.finance/), a project under [Catalog](https://www.catalog.fi/), where I contributed to building:
- [BTC/ERC20 Faucet](https://testnetbtc.com/): A Web3 faucet for distributing BTC and ERC20 tokens
- Writing [demo CLI](https://docs.garden.finance/cookbook/demo-cli) & [demo dApp](https://docs.garden.finance/cookbook/demo-dapp) for the [Garden SDK cookbook](https://docs.garden.finance/)

Some of my projects:
- [Naash](https://devfolio.co/projects/yaash-yet-another-ai-shell-192b): An AI-powered shell. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xZ1Gxxiu1U)
- [Locus](https://github.com/Sushants-Git/locus): Intelligent activity tracker that helps you understand and improve your focus habits
- [Deja-vu](https://github.com/Sushants-Git/Deja-Vu): AI-powered Chrome Extension which offers a seamless way to find bookmarks
