I am a software engineer building for the web and Linux distros. My interests lie in building enterprise-level applications and crafting UI/UX that's ergonomic to use.

Currently Working at [Swipe (YC 21)](https://getswipe.in/).

My recent experience was as a full-stack developer intern at [Garden Finance](https://garden.finance/), a project under [Catalog](https://www.catalog.fi/), where I contributed to building [BTC/ERC20 Faucet](https://testnetbtc.com/) a Web3 faucet for distributing BTC and ERC20 tokens.
